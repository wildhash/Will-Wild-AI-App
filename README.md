## üìä Risk Assessment System

### Risk Levels

| Level | Score Range | Characteristics | Response |
|-------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| **Low** | 0.0 - 0.3 | General support seeking | Supportive conversation |
| **Moderate** | 0.3 - 0.6 | Mild to moderate distress | Coping strategies, CBT |
| **High** | 0.6 - 0.8 | Significant mental health concerns | Professional referral + support |
| **Crisis** | 0.8 - 1.0 | Immediate danger indicators | Emergency resources + escalation |

### Detection Methods

1. **Rule-based Keywords**: Immediate detection of crisis language
2. **AI Analysis**: Nuanced understanding of context and intent
3. **Historical Patterns**: Trend analysis from previous interactions
4. **Combined Scoring**: Weighted combination of all assessment methods

## üéØ Therapeutic Interventions

### CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy)
- **Thought Challenging**: Evidence-based cognitive restructuring
- **Behavioral Activation**: Activity scheduling and mood improvement
- **Homework Assignments**: Practice exercises and skill development

### Grounding Techniques
- **5-4-3-2-1 Technique**: Sensory grounding for anxiety and panic
- **Box Breathing**: Regulated breathing for stress reduction
- **Body Scan**: Mindfulness-based anxiety management

### Crisis Intervention
- **De-escalation**: Calm, supportive crisis communication
- **Safety Planning**: Immediate safety protocol development
- **Resource Connection**: Crisis hotlines and emergency services

## üîß API Endpoints (FastAPI)

### Core Chat
- `POST /chat` - Main conversation endpoint
- `GET /session/{id}/summary` - Session analytics
- `POST /session/{id}/end` - End therapy session

### User Management
- `GET /user/{id}/profile` - User profile and progress
- `POST /user/{id}/profile` - Update user preferences

### Safety & Resources
- `GET /crisis-resources` - Emergency contact information
- `GET /health` - Service health check

## üîí Safety & Compliance

### Crisis Detection
- Immediate identification of suicidal ideation
- Self-harm risk assessment
- Escalation to human professionals
- Emergency service integration

### Privacy & Security
- No persistent storage of sensitive data (in current stub implementation)
- Secure session management
- Audit logging for compliance
- Data encryption ready (TODO)

### Ethical AI
