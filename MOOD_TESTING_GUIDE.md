# ðŸŽ­ Mood Tracking Quick Start Guide

This guide helps judges quickly test and evaluate the mood tracking functionality.

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup (2 minutes)

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Start the API server:**
   ```bash
   python -m src.main
   ```

3. **Open the demo interface:**
   - Start a web server: `python -m http.server 3000`
   - Open: http://localhost:3000/mood_demo.html

## ðŸ§ª Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Basic Mood Detection
Try these phrases in the chat:
- **Happy**: "I'm so excited and happy about this!"
- **Sad**: "I feel really sad and down today"
- **Anxious**: "I'm very worried and anxious about tomorrow"
- **Angry**: "This is so frustrating and annoying!"
- **Neutral**: "Let's discuss the weather"

**Expected Result**: Each message shows mood detection with confidence scores and keywords.

### Test 2: Mood Timeline
Send multiple messages with different moods:
1. "I'm feeling great and excited!" (Happy)
2. "But now I'm worried about the deadline" (Anxious)
3. "Actually, I'm feeling better now" (Happy)

**Expected Result**: Mood timeline shows 3 entries with transitions, analytics show 2 mood changes.

### Test 3: API Testing
Use curl or test_api.py:
```bash
# Send a message
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id": "judge_test", "message": "I am absolutely thrilled!"}'

# Get mood data
curl http://localhost:8000/api/mood/judge_test
```

**Expected Result**: JSON response with mood analysis and session summary.

### Test 4: Comprehensive Test Suite
```bash
python test_api.py
```

**Expected Result**: All mood categories tested with 95%+ confidence scores.
